# smtpd_sasl_path (default:smtpd) 

 Implementation-specific information that the Postfix SMTP server
passes through to
the SASL plug-in implementation that is selected with
smtpd_sasl_type.  Typically this specifies the name of a
configuration file or rendezvous point. 

 This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later. In earlier
releases it was called smtpd_sasl_application_name.
