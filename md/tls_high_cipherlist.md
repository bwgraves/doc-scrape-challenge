# tls_high_cipherlist (default:see"postconf-d"output); 

 The OpenSSL cipherlist for "high" grade ciphers. This defines

smtpd_tls_mandatory_ciphers, smtp_tls_ciphers, smtp_tls_mandatory_ciphers,
lmtp_tls_ciphers, and lmtp_tls_mandatory_ciphers. You are strongly
encouraged not to change this setting.  

 This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.
