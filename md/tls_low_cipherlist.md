# tls_low_cipherlist 

 The OpenSSL cipherlist for "low" or higher grade ciphers. This defines
the meaning of the "low" setting in smtpd_tls_ciphers,
smtpd_tls_mandatory_ciphers, smtp_tls_ciphers, smtp_tls_mandatory_ciphers,
lmtp_tls_ciphers, and lmtp_tls_mandatory_ciphers. You are strongly
encouraged not to change this setting.  

 This feature is available in Postfix 2.3 and later.
