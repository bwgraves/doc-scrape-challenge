# unknown_address_reject_code (default:450) 


The numerical response code when the Postfix SMTP server rejects a
sender or recipient address because its domain is unknown.  This
is one of the possible replies from the restrictions
reject_unknown_sender_domain and reject_unknown_recipient_domain.



Do not change this unless you have a complete understanding of RFC 5321.
