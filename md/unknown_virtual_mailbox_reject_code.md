# unknown_virtual_mailbox_reject_code (default:550); 


The Postfix SMTP server reply code when a recipient address matches
$virtual_mailbox_domains, and $virtual_mailbox_maps specifies a list
of lookup tables that does not match the recipient address.



This feature is available in Postfix 2.0 and later.
